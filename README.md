## **Project Overview**

This project aims to provide a robust, secure, and user-friendly electronic access control system that meets the needs of modern organizations, enhancing convenience, security, and operational efficiency. This transforms physical badges into an electronically cloud-based platform for logging and tracking employee access. The solution includes both a mobile application and a web portal for convenient access and management.

## **Key Features**

- **Mobile App and Web Portal**: Employees can check in/out, view their attendance records, and request access.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Managers can monitor attendance, generate reports, and manage user permissions.
- **Notifications and Alerts**: Reminders for upcoming shifts, notifications about access revocation, and alerts for unauthorized access attempts.
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Enhancing security with biometrics, OTPs, or other authentication methods.
- **Geo-fencing**: Ensuring check-in/out can only occur at designated locations.
- **Audit Logs**: Detailed logs of all access attempts for compliance and security reviews.
- **Customizable Reports**: Generating tailored reports for specific needs.

## **Advantages**

- **Convenience and Accessibility**: Employees can use smartphones or other devices for access.
- **Real-time Data**: Instant access to employee attendance and movement data.
